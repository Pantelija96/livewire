# Laravel + Livewire Practice Project

This is a practice project built while following the *Laravel Beginner Fundamentals* course on Udemy. It’s meant to solidify my understanding of Laravel, Livewire, and the related ecosystem by implementing real features and building hands-on projects.

## What this project is

A practice application built as part of the Udemy *Laravel Beginner Fundamentals* course, where I:

- Built CRUD-based applications to get comfortable with Laravel’s MVC architecture.  
- Used Livewire to add interactivity and reactive components without a heavy front-end framework.  
- Practiced form validation, user authentication (if implemented), file uploads (if implemented), and database relations.

---

## Features Implemented

Here are some of the features I implemented (customize this list to match your project):

- Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- Livewire components for reactive UI: real-time form validation, dynamic filtering / search  
- User authentication & authorization (login/register)  
- Database migrations and seeders 
- Relationship handling between models (e.g. one-to-many, many-to-many)  
- Flash messages and error handling

---

## What I Learnt

During the course and through building this project, I gained experience with:

- Laravel fundamentals: routing, controllers, models, views  
- Eloquent ORM and database migrations  
- Livewire: component lifecycle, property binding, event handling  
- Form validation (on server and, where relevant, via Livewire)  
- Blade templating  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Laravel (specify version)  
- **Reactive UI:** Livewire (specify version)  
- **Database:** MySQL / SQLite / PostgreSQL (whichever you used)  
- **Frontend tooling:** Blade templates, possibly Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap (if used)  
- **Other tools:** Composer, npm (or yarn), etc.


---

## Future Improvements

 - Some features I plan (or could plan) to add:
 - Better UI/UX styling (e.g., using a design framework)
 - More Livewire components: modals, tabs, pagination, real-time updates via polling/events
 - Tests: unit tests, feature tests (especially for Livewire components)
 - More advanced validation rules
 - More relationships and complex data structures
 - Using queues, notifications, scheduled tasks if course didn’t cover them
